I uploaded two models to predict stock price. First model is implemented by xgboost and the second is implemented by lstm. If you want to run them, put the train_data and test_data files and the code under same path and run the .py file.
The projects require following libraries:
Tensorflow 1.2.1 
Python 1.6.2
Pandas 0.23.4
Numpy 1.12.1
Xgboost 0.6
keras 2.1.2
Sklearn 0.19.0
