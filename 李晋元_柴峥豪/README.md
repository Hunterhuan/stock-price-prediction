Usekeras.py implements LSTM by keras, it requires additional  csv file to run. For this method hasn't been modified since 10 days ago, if you find some detailed mistakes, please contact us.



xgb2.py also requires two preprocessed csv to run, by which we achieved 0.00150 on public board. What should be noticed is that predata.py here is not suitable for direct run because I retained some deprecated attempts in it. If you want to run this code, you can also contact us for the preprocessed data.
